- **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels (standardized)
- **Format**: PNG/JPG
- **Split**: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

### Chess Positions Dataset  
- **Format**: Stockfish binary packed data (sfbinpack format)
- **Size**: 1M+ positions
- **Sources**: Engine self-play, master games, tactical puzzles
- **Evaluations**: Centipawn values and game outcomes

### Behavioral Analysis Dataset
- **Format**: SQLite database with extracted features
- **Games**: 1M+ annotated chess games
- **Features**: Time patterns, move accuracy, engine correlation
- **Labels**: Binary classification (legitimate/suspicious)

## Database Setup

## Usage Notes

### For Hook Lens (Computer Vision)
- Images should be preprocessed to 32x32 pixels
- Ensure consistent lighting and perspective in custom datasets
- Use the provided train/test split for reproducible results

### For Rusty Brain (Chess Engine)
- Position evaluations should be in centipawn format
- Use Stockfish binary packed format (sfbinpack) for training data
- Include diverse position types (opening, middlegame, endgame)

### For Rough Guard (Behavioral Analysis)
- Features should be normalized for optimal model performance
- Maintain class balance or use appropriate weighting strategies
- Include temporal features for behavioral pattern detection
